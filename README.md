# delete-your-RAW-DYR
when we get home with a load of pictures, it's annoying to have deal with massive pics. If you saved both JEPG and RAW, you may view the pics through jepg. This program helps you delete the RAW according to the jepg you have deleted
just change the path to your's, and the in the 'path', there should also have some different directory. this will helps the program working in the right way. Also change the suffix according to your RAW form
